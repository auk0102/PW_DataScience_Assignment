        "- States that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches normality as sample size increases, regardless of the original distribution.\n",

        "###14. How does the Central Limit Theorem relate to the normal distribution?\n",
        "- It shows that no matter what the original data looks like, the averages of large samples will be normally distributed. This connection makes the normal distribution a powerful tool in analysis.\n",

        "###18. What is the significance of confidence intervals in statistical analysis?\n",
        "- Confidence intervals help us understand the reliability of an estimate. They show a range of likely values for a population parameter and give a sense of how sure we are about our estimate. Provide a range of plausible values for a parameter.\n",
